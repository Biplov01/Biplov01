👋 Hi, I'm Biplov Paneru
🚀 Machine Learning Engineer | Data scientist & Cloud-Ops Engineer

Former AI Engineer in Bengaluru, currently working as a Data & Cloud Engineer for an Australian-based company, building intelligent systems, scalable pipelines, and cloud-native ML solutions. I specialize in NLP, deep learning, traditional ML models, MLOps, and end-to-end production AI systems.

I love designing systems that combine ML + Data Engineering + Cloud to solve real-world problems—everything from predictive models to LLM-powered applications, feature engineering, and model optimization.

🔥 What I Work On

✅ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
✅Kaggle top contributor
✅ Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers)
✅ Traditional ML Models (SVM, RF, CatBoost, XGBoost)
✅ Data Engineering (ETL, Airflow, Spark, BigQuery)
✅ Cloud (GCP, AWS, Azure)
✅ MLOps (Docker, CI/CD, Model Deployment)
✅ Computer Vision (YOLO, EfficientNet, DenseNet)
